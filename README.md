icsConverterWebapp
==================
Google App Engine hosted Python webapp to convert a properly formatted .csv file to functioning .ics file. See my post [here](http://n8henrie.com/2013/05/spreadsheet-to-calendar/) for details.

~~icsConverterWebapp Live~~: Used to be hosted at
http://icsconverterwebapp.n8henrie.com, but now updated version is [live at
icw.n8henrie.com](http://icw.n8henrie.com), source code at
<https://github.com/n8henrie/icw>.

icsConverter (desktop version) at GitHub [here](https://github.com/n8henrie/icsConverter), compiled for OSX [here](http://n8henrie.com/2013/05/spreadsheet-to-calendar/).

**Disclaimer:** I honestly have no idea what I'm doing with Python, Git, Google App Engine, or really any of this... so be careful if you use this code.
