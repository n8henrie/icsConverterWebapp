icsConverter (desktop version) at GitHub [here](https://github.com/n8henrie/icsConverter), compiled for OSX [here](http://n8henrie.com/2013/05/spreadsheet-to-calendar/).

**Disclaimer:** I honestly have no idea what I'm doing with Python, Git, Google App Engine, or really any of this... so be careful if you use this code.
